## Example aliases.conf
# Format: name=/absolute/or/relative/path/to/script
# Lines starting with # are ignored.
# Prefer relative paths (relative to this project) so the installer can package the script
# into the installation directory and make the alias portable across users.

# Example using an absolute path (works only if that path exists on the target machine):
# connect-to-cluster=/home/admin/Documents/GNP/Scripts/connect_gke_cluster.sh

# Example using a relative path (recommended). The installer will look relative to the
# project root and to tools/ and then copy the script into ~/.gnp-tools/bin
# Prefer placing executables in `Proyecto-Tools/bin/` — all executable files there
# will be automatically installed and will generate aliases with the file name
# (the `.sh` extension is stripped when creating the alias name).
connect-to-cluster=../Scripts/connect_gke_cluster.sh
